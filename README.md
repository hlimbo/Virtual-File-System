# Virtual-File-System
Project in Operating Systems Course at UCI

Virtual File System's job is to manage application data loaded onto the hard disk when the computer's main memory (RAM) capacity has been reached.The main task of the Virtual File System being implemented is to translate virtual addresses into physical addresses where the physical memory is implemented as an array of integers. 

Features to implement in this system:
1. uses segmentation and paging
2. simulated main memory (ram)
3. translates virtual addresses into physical addresses according to the current contents of segment and page tables
4. uses (Translation Look-aside Buffer) TLB to make the translation process more efficient
